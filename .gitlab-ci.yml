# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
#  - deploy

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - python3 --version
    - make install

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 2 seconds."
    - sleep 2

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - make precommit

#deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
#  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
#  environment: production
#  script:
#    - echo "Deploying application..."
#    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
